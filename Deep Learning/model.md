# Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation Models

This folder contains the models and datasets for crop recommendation and fertilizer recommendation. These models are designed to assist farmers and agronomists in making informed decisions about which crops to plant and what type of fertilizer to use for optimal crop yield.

# Dataset Description

## Fertilizer Recommendation Dataset

This [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jshndeep/fertilizer-recommendation)
includes environmental and soil parameters to help in recommending the appropriate fertilizer for specific crops.

- Temperature: Ambient temperature measured in degrees Celsius.
- Humidity: Relative air humidity measured in percentage.
- Moisture: Moisture content of the soil.
- Soil Type: Classification of soil based on its physical and chemical properties.
- Crop Type: Type of crop.
- Nitrogen (N): Ratio of nitrogen content in the soil.
- Potassium (K): Ratio of potassium content in the soil.
- Phosphorous (P): Ratio of phosphorous content in the soil.
- Fertilizer Name: Name of the recommended fertilizer.
